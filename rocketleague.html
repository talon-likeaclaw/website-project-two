        <h3 class="rl_header">What is Rocket League?</h3>
        <p>Rocket League is a popular videogame that combines elements of soccer and (in my opinion) hockey with
          vehicular mayhem. Developed and published by Psyonix, it was initially released in July 2015 for various
          gaming platforms. The game's unique blend of sports and vehicular action has made it a global phenomenon.
          <br><br>
          In Rocket League, players control customizable rocket-powered cars, which they use to play a variant of
          soccer. The objective is to score goals by hitting a giant ball into the opposing team's goal while also
          defending their own goal. A match of Rocket League is typically five minute, unless the teams are tied at
          the end of the 5 minute counter; in which case there is sudden-death overtime The game can be played in
          various modes, including solo duels, 2v2, and 3v3.
          There
          are other variations of the classic game of Rocket League, including Hoops (basketball), Snow Day
          (hockey),
          Dropshot (unique floor breaking game), and Rumble (a mode with randomized power-ups.

        <h4 class="rl_sub_header">Key Features of Rocket League:</h4>
        <ul class="rl_ul">
          <li><strong>High Flying Action:</strong> The rocket-powered cars can jump, flip, boost, and air roll;
            allowing for acrobatic maneuvers and spectacular plays.</li>
          <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Rocket League is an easy game to pick up, but an extremely challenging
            game to master. There are various mechanics to train, such as Dribbling, Air Dribbling, Wave Dashing,
            Flip Resets, Ceiling Shots, Shooting, Aerials, and more.
          <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Players can customize their cars with various skins, decals, toppers,
            and other cosmetic items to make their vehicles unique.</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive Play:</strong> The game has a competitive ranking system, where players can climb
            the ranks by participating in ranked matches, aiming to become a top-tier player.</li>

            ball touches the ground. Zero-second goals can lead to dramatic and intense endings to matches, or
            beginnings to sudden death overtimes.</li>
          <li><strong>Demolitions:</strong> You can intentionally crash your car into an opponent's car, temporarily
            removing it from the game in a big explosion. Demolitions add an exciting element to the game, but they
            are high-risk, high-reward plays.</li>
          <li><strong>Esports:</strong> Rocket League has a thriving esports scene with tournaments and competitions
            at various levels, from community events to professional championships. They 2023 World Championship had
